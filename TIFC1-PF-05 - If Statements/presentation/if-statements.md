## What Would Happen if I Ran This?

Think about what would happen if this piece of code ran. Walk through line by line and guess! The rest of this unit will break down the concepts seen in this piece of code and more. Let's dive in!

```py
foods = ['tuna', 'mackerel', 'salmon', 'sardines']

answer = input("What would you like to eat today boys?\n")

if answer.lower() == 'tuna':
    print(f"Okay, let's have {foods[0]} for dinner!" )
elif answer.lower() == 'mackerel':
    print(f"Okay, let's have {foods[1]} for dinner!")
elif answer.lower() == 'salmon':
    print(f"Okay, let's have {foods[2]} for dinner!")
elif answer == foods[3]:
    print(f"Okay, let's have {foods[3]} for dinner!")
else:
    print("Sorry boys! I only have chicken for dinner!")
```

## Boolean Expressions

This is a name for a conditional test - it is checking for whether or not something is TRUE or FALSE. 

You can imagine all of the use cases for this! 

## If Statements

If statements are conditional statements. They look for whether a statement is true or false, then it can do something based on the result. 

A good analogy of an if statement is visiting a coffee shop. 

Imagine you are walking into a coffee shop, hoping to get a coffee or a selection of treats. There are a few people ahead of you in the line, so while you are waiting you check out the menu. Latte, americano, cappucino... It all looks great!... Then your eyes fall on the selection of sweet treats on the counter. A warm cinnamon roll, freshly baked croissant, creamy cheese danish, and a slice of a rich brownie. It all looks delicious, so you start to think about what you would prefer to order from the selection of treats. You decide that you want something simple, a classic butter croissant. However, you notice that someone in the line has ordered a croissant - oh no! So you decide that if there are croissants left, then you will buy one. Otherwise, the warm cinnamon roll is calling your name so you may just order that instead. 

As the people in front of you in line make their orders, you also notice that the warm cinnamon rolls numbers are now dwindling. So you need to give yourself another option to choose from if the croissants and cinnamon rolls are sold out. You peer over the counter to see the rich cheese danish and chocolate brownie. You decide that if the butter croissant is avaiable, you will order this. Otherwise, if the cinnamon roll is available, you will order that. If both the cinnamon roll and the croissant is unavailable, then you will order the chocolate brownie but if that is unavailable then you will order the cheese danish. If all else fails and none of these options are available, you decide that it is not worth ordering anything and will leave the coffee shop. 

This scenario is very similar to how if statements work. If statements are looking for whether something is true or false, and then taking actions that you specify. Let's start with our first choice, the humble butter croissant: 

```py
if there is a croissant, 
    Then I will buy the croissant
```
Although this is not syntaxually correct, the concept of an if statement still applies. Python will look at that first line of code `if there is a croissant available` and will evaluate whether this is true or false. If the statement is evaluated as true, then Python will run the action `Then I will buy the croissant'. If there are no croissants available, then the statement will be evaluated as false and that action will not run. Now, let's take a look at an if statement with the correct syntax: 

```py
food = input("What would you like to order? \n")

if food.lower() == 'croissant':
    print("You have bought a croissant!")
```

Try running the above code. The code will prompt you in the terminal to order something. Think about the menu in the scenario from before, try ordering a croissant. If you type in croissant, then

## Comparison Operators

## Checking Whether an Item is not in a list

```py
foods = ['tuna', 'sardines', 'chicken', 'beef']
unhappy_foods = 'avocado'

if unhappy_foods not in foods:
    print(unhappy_foods + " is not on the list, sorry!")
```

```py
foods = ['tuna', 'sardines', 'chicken', 'beef', 'avocado']
unhappy_foods = 'avocado'

if unhappy_foods not in foods:
    print(unhappy_foods + " is not on the list, sorry!")
else:
    print("Hooray we have it!")
```

## if-elif-else

```py
foods = ['tuna', 'mackerel', 'salmon', 'sardines']

answer = input("What would you like to eat today boys?\n")

if answer.lower() == 'tuna':
    print(f"Okay, let's have {foods[0]} for dinner!" )
elif answer.lower() == 'mackerel':
    print(f"Okay, let's have {foods[1]} for dinner!")
elif answer.lower() == 'salmon':
    print(f"Okay, let's have {foods[2]} for dinner!")
elif answer == foods[3]:
    print(f"Okay, let's have {foods[3]} for dinner!")
else:
    print("Sorry boys! I only have chicken for dinner!")
```

## Using if statements with loops and lists

```py
foods = ['tuna', 'sardines', 'chicken', 'beef', 'avocado']

for food in foods:
    if food == 'chicken':
        print(f"I know you don't like chicken, but this is good for you!")
    else:
        print(f"We have {food} in the pantry, let's eat!")
       
print("No more food! Goodbye!")
```

## Having Multiple Lists!

```py
available_foods = ['tuna', 'sardines', 'halloumi', 'chicken', 'beef', 'salmon', 'avocado']
disliked_foods = ['chicken', 'beef', 'turkey', 'bacon']

for food in available_foods:
    if food in disliked_foods:
        print(f"I know you don't like this, but it is good for you!!")
    else:
        print(f"Yay! We have something you like!")
       
print("No more food! Goodbye!")
```

## Back to Our Code from the Start!

```py
foods = ['tuna', 'mackerel', 'salmon', 'sardines']

answer = input("What would you like to eat today boys?\n")

if answer.lower() == 'tuna':
    print(f"Okay, let's have {foods[0]} for dinner!" )
elif answer.lower() == 'mackerel':
    print(f"Okay, let's have {foods[1]} for dinner!")
elif answer.lower() == 'salmon':
    print(f"Okay, let's have {foods[2]} for dinner!")
elif answer == foods[3]:
    print(f"Okay, let's have {foods[3]} for dinner!")
else:
    print("Sorry boys! I only have chicken for dinner!")
```
