# Python Project
## Bookshop and Cafe Application
### Introduction

As a DevOps Engineer for a a large Cloud consultancy, a rapidly growing independent bookshop & cafe has engaged you to create an application which their customers can use to submit their orders remotely, and also their employees can use to carry out general day to day admin.

The shop has a cafe that serves drinks, cakes, and a selection of bestselling books.

### Requirements

First choose a Team name - book/coffee shop puns encouraged :)

Your client has a range of functionality they require in their app:
- An easy to navigate user interface
- Display a list of the menu and book items
- Allow customers to order food, drinks, and books
- Allow customers to view additional details about products
- Allow customers to review their order
- Allow employees to apply promotional discounts

### Stretch Goals
- Allow employees to add new menu/book items.
- Allow employees to update stock items.
- Allow customers to order books for delivery
- Add access control to employee functions

### 'Blue Sky' Requests
The client would like to have a customer sign-up program for their regulars, once the customers details have been saved the customer should be able to:
- Order books for delivery more quickly as their details are aleady on record.
- Receive a loyalty discount for every 10 purchases.
- The customer records should be accesible to employees only.

**The client also welcomes any ideas you have to improve their application which they may not have considered.**

## Submission Requirements

When you finish writing your application, you will present the program to your client (cohort). The presentation does not need to be more than 5 minutes, but every team member should contribute, and you should expect questions from your client.

In your presentation, include the following:
- Showcase your app - **It is not necessary that all functionality is present, but do aim for a version that runs**
- Explain how it works *in language your client can understand*.
- What was your favorite part of the project?
- What did you learn while doing this project?
- What sort of challenges did you and your group encounter and how did you overcome them?
- Do you have a plan to finish anything not completed?
- What else would you do if you had more time?
- Would you add any more functionality?

## Tips

Think about teamwork, and strategy. Projects will often comprise people with more skills and experience than others, this how the new people learn. How can you share the workload in a way that maximises productivity?

For example, some people may be confident writing complex classes, and functions which access nested dictionaries; But you also need someone who can create well formatted print statements which will guide the end user through the options and interface. You also need someone to write out the base dictionaries, lists, etc. which require attention to detail to ensure they're formatted correctly.
  
Everyone should be able to make valuable contributions.

Some more guidance:

- Spend some time planning before you start coding. Try using tools like whiteboards, Trello, or anything you like to collaborate, plan, track progress, and visualise your app and logic.
- Implement some form of version control - it's very frustrating to have a working version, then find the whole thing breaks when a new feature or change is added, and you can't easily revert.
- Although you are developing the application as a team, each person should ultimately have their own copy which they can continue developing in their own time and post-grauation in order to personalise it. For this reason everyone needs to have an understanding of the whole thing, so **communicate**.
- You were given an early 'heads-up' about the project so that you can start thinking about it, and some people may have also started working on some prototype code. This additional practice and forethought will be valuable for your group, and you're welcome to bring small code blocks into your project. *But for everyone's benefit, you should be mostly starting from scratch*.
- Agree on deadlines, one person's delay can impact everyone else in the team.
- Do not neglect your presentation - it is recommended that you aim for the latest running version of the app to be ready one hour before the submission time, then everyone works on the presentation and agrees the speaking order.
- Remember the context of the project - your team is a consultancy, presenting a proposal and prototype to a potential client.

Once your app is finished you are expected to create a ZIP file of your working directory and upload it into your cohort's 'Files' area.

For the presentations a feedback form will be provided to everyone, they are expected to submit feedback on each of their colleagues proposals. This will be collated and shared by your instructor the following day.
