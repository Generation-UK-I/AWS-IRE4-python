## Instructor Prep

- Note: These session plans include sections where long explanations are provided simply because it is important to ensure that these tricky concepts are communicated as clearly as possible. However, it is not expected that the instructor will recite these verbatim, feel free to use your own refined and well-honed approach as long as the learning point is covered. The provided narrative is always available if needed.
- Learning and delivery can be more effective if resources and tasks are personalised. If time permits, feel free to update slides with your own examples such as replacing cat examples with your own pets, or anything else.
