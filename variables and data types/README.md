# Variables, Strings, and Data Types

This module is the first practical Python unit in the course. This module aims to introduce foundational concepts of variables, strings, and different data types. 

Please start by going through the session plan and the slide deck for this module.  When finished teaching, refer learners to the exercises to complete. The session plan is listed below to help assist with the teaching of this module.

## Session Objectives 

- Explain what a variable is and why theyâ€™re used
- Be able to identify a number of variable types
- Select the appropriate variable type for a given scenario
- Store and recall data using a variable

## Key Points

- Working with Variables
- What is a string
- Using strings in Python - concatenating and using string methods
- Using numbers in Python - integers, floats
- Understanding and avoiding TypeErrors

## Assessment

Via practical challenges

## Instructor Prep

- Note: These session plans include sections where long explanations are provided simply because it is important to ensure that these tricky concepts are communicated as clearly as possible. However, it is not expected that the instructor will recite these verbatim, feel free to use your own refined and well-honed approach as long as the learning point is covered. The provided narrative is always available if needed.
- Learning and delivery can be more effective if resources and tasks are personalised. If time permits, feel free to update slides with your own examples such as replacing cat examples with your own pets, or anything else.
