## Introducing Dictionaries

Dictionaries are containers for collections of key value pairs. 

A key value pair (KVP) is just a set of values that are associated with each other. Dictionaries can store an almost limitless amount of pairs.

Although the syntax is a little trickier, dictionaries are quite similar to lists, except each item has two components, the key and value. We can add, remove, edit, and retrieve keys, values, or both. We can also loop through our dictionaries just like lists. 

We declare dictonaries using curly brackets {}
