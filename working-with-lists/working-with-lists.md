## Working with Lists
---

#### Learning Objectives:
- In this session we will:
- Understand and use For Loops
- Use the Range function
- Use some more list functions
- Slice and Copy lists
- Understand Tuples vs. Lists
---

#### Take a Look!
```py
foods = ["tuna", "salmon", "mackerel", "trout"]

print("Okay Weasley, you can eat any of the following for dinner:")

for food in foods:
    print("You can have " + food + " for dinner. ")
    print("or....")
   
print("Nothing!")
```

#### For Loops


### Let's Take a Math Break!
---
#### Making Numerical Lists

#### 'range()' function

#### `list()` function

#### Finding min, max, and sum of digits

### Back to Our Teaching Assistants!

#### Slicing a List


#### Looping Through a Slice

#### Copying a List


#### Tuples


#### Redefining a Tuple

### Back to our code from the start!

### Well done! Now move onto the Working with Lists Exercises!
