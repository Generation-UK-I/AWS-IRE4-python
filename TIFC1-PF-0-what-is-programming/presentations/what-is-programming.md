## What is Programming?
---

If you have never programmed before, you may be thinking... What even is programming?

A simple definition: Programming is giving instructions to a computer so it can do something. For example, telling a computer to solve a math problem, 
creating a game with instructions on how the game will run, websites, etc.. Programs can range from something really simple to something really complex. Here is an example of a simple program: 

```py
name = "noche"

print("My cat, " + name.title() + ", is a very picky eater."
print("Today, all I have for dinner is tuna and seaweed.")
```

There is a lot of concepts to unpack here! However, that is what this Python module is for, learning the concepts of programming and how to be able to build programs like this, or something far more complex! 
Before we dive in though, let's talk about the history of programming. 

### History of Programming

A woman named Ada Lovelace is credited with developing the first programming language in 1883. She and Charles Babbage both worked together to create the Analytical Engine, which was a mechanical computer that Babbage proposed in the early 1830s. The Analytical Engine is considered to be one of the earliest designs for a computer. 
Lovelace wrote an algorithm for the Analytical Engine in order to compute Bernoulli numbers for the machine. This algorithmn is considered to be the first programming language, and Lovelace the first programmer.
